Thank you for purchasing Toon Planes!

Version 1.3:

	The assets are very simple to use, just drag and drop one of the prefabs into the scene.

	
		Aircraft:


	The aircrafts have separated pieces, with centered pivot points. For example, the planes
have separated flaps, ailerons, rudders, elevators and landing gears. The helicopters have
separated rotors and landing gears.

	The engine intakes and propellers are also separated and have centered pivots

	Landing gears are animated with takeoff and landing animations. A simple animator has been
setup where applicable, though further editing would probably be needed.



		Naming convention:



	The assets in this package use the "TP" prefix, in case you're using other packs from the TOON Series, to be able to easily 
identify the origin of an asset.
	The last letter in the name, usually is a capital letter, such as :"TP_Plane_02A". It signifies the color scheme of the asset.
If there are more color schemes for an asset, the naming would probably continue as follows: "TP_Plane_02B", "TP_Plane_02C".

	In the case of wheels of the vehicles, character rig bones, and other animateable assets, the suffixes ".L" and ".R" are used. 
For example, the rear left wheel of a car would be named: "TP_Van_01B_Wheel_R.L".




		Prefabs:



	The source files are contained in the "Models" folder, along with the custom mesh colliders, in the "Colliders" sub-folder. 
Custom mesh colliders were used where the shape of the asset was too complicated to use simple "box" or "sphere" colliders.

	The Prefabs are structured in multiple folders.


		Scene:


	There is a scene included in this pack, with a plethora of assets.

	To achieve the lighting effect there is a post-processing profile included in the project, which requires the post processing stack
to be installed (if you're using URP, the post processing stack isn't needed).
	If you install the post processing stack after importing this package, some errors might appear, depending on the version of Unity 
that you're using. A Unity restart usually solves those issues. (if not, please re-import this pack in a project where post processing 
stack is installed).

	

		Characters:


	There are 6 character templates (3 male & 3 female), located in the "Characters Source" folder. The templates have customizable 
items (clothes, accessories, skin color, ...) which you can activate/deactivate as you please, thus being able to create numerous variants.
Some pre-made variants have been saved as prefabs in the "Characters Variants" folder.

	The characters have no animations included in the package. 
The rigging system is "Humanoid", which allows for the use of external animations, either from the Asset Store, or other external sources, 
such as "Mixamo.com".


		Vehicles:


	All the vehicles come with interiors, detached wheels, doors and other working items.
